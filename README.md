# FAQ Schema Generator (easy for Webflow project integration)
This generates FAQ schema for items on a web page

You'll need each question and answer wrapped in a element with the class of `faq-item` and inside of it you should have your question classed with `faq-question` and your answer with `faq-answer`.

You can copy and paste this script into your project on the page you want it on and put it above the closing body tag. Or you can serve this via JS deliver which is a CDN by going here: https://www.jsdelivr.com/github and pasting a link to the file or repo into it and using the url it spits out in your project like so `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/austin-thesing/faq-schema@main/index.js"></script>`
